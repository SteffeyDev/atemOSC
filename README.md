### atemOSC has moved

atemOSC is now fully supported and back under active development! I've rebuilt the app with a new UI, new features, and better documentation. I've decided to move away from GitHub as a distribution & support platform to make things simpler for many of you who are not software developers. Go to [atemosc.com](https://atemosc.com) to see the future of atemOSC and download the latest version.



I've moved this to my new internal issue tracker for [version 5](https://github.com/SteffeyDev/atemOSC/releases/tag/v5.0.0). If it is still something you would like, buying a license for version 5 and submitting this as a support request on www.atemosc.com/support would make it a higher priority for me.

I've released a [new major version](https://github.com/SteffeyDev/atemOSC/releases/tag/v5.0.0), please test on that and open a support request at www.atemosc.com/support if there are still issues.
