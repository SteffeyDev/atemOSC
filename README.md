### atemOSC has moved

atemOSC is now fully supported and back under active development! I've rebuilt the app with a new UI, new features, and better documentation. I've decided to move away from GitHub as a distribution & support platform to make things simpler for many of you who are not software developers. Go to [atemosc.com](https://atemosc.com) to see the future of atemOSC and download the latest version.
