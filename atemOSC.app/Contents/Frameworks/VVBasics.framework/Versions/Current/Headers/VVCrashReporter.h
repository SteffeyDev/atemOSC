///	Simple class which automatically uploads crash logs and other relevant diagnostic information automatically made available by os x to a remote server.
/*!
it's been my experience that most apps crash much more frequently on end-users than the app's developers would guess.  the simplest and easiest way to improve the end-user's experience is to have the application check their machine for crash logs- which are generated automatically by os x whenever an application crashes- and send them to the developer.

this class exists so i have a really easy way to make my apps send their crash logs to me; the goal here is to make it as easy as possible to get all the information i need to troubleshoot a problem with as little work on the user's part as possible.  it also sends a basic system profile, anything the app- and ONLY the app, not other apps- recently printed to the console log, and optional description/email fields to facilitate communication directly with the user.  this data is then uploaded to a given URL using an HTTP POST.

on the server side, i use a PHP page which sanitizes the POST data (i can't stress how important this step is) and works with it.  i've included a sample PHP page that simply dumps the received data to a file on disk (and optionally emails someone) with this project.

HOW TO USE THIS CLASS:

	1)- create an instance of this class
	
	2)- set the instance's delegate, uploadURL, and developerEmail.  these are necessary!
	
	3)- call "check" on the instance.  when it's done, it calls "crashReporterCheckDone" on the 
		delegate.  that's it- you're done.
